Welcome to Dr. K's Business Math Notes on Github
---

### Note to Students

Unless you're trying to contribute your own notes or code to the project, you probably just want to go to the [main site](https://jkeneda.github.io/business-math/).

### Project To Do List:

1. Generalize the function graphing plugin

1. Add questions/answers via jquery

1. Add jquery dialog/tooltips on hover for definitions/theorems

1. Auto-number quiz questions, examples, etc.

1. Fix spoiler nonsense at the end of functions section

1. (Wait for package/library support in TikZJax)

1. Fix any broken links from missing adjacent pages (currently linked as tbd)

1. Fix desmos unloading issue (see footnotes of examples page)

#### Notable Dependencies
This project uses [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) and [TikZJax](https://github.com/kisonecat/tikzjax) for its graphing, and it uses the [Cayman](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman) Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages.  It'll probably start using jquery for some better interactivity soon.
