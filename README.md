Welcome to Dr. K's Business Math Notes on Github
===

Unless you're trying to contribute your own notes to the project, you probably just want to go to the [main site](https://jkeneda.github.io/business-math/).

### To do:

0. Add questions/answers via jquery

1. Add jquery dialog/tooltips on hover for definitions/theorems

2. Add more content pages

3. Add graphing abilities from chartjs

4. Clean up the MathJax-config in each folder and auto-number examples and stuff
