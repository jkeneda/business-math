Linear Functions
===

In this section, we look at one of the simplest classes of functions: linear functions.

## Closely Related Quantities

Linear functions arise when one quantity has a *constant rate of change* with respect to another.  We saw an example of this earlier, where we computed [shipping costs](1-1-b-function-definitions.html#example-2).

Let's recall that function: $$f(x) = \$8.25 x$$.  Note that every time our order number $$x$$ goes up by 1, the shipping cost should go up by $8.25.  So we say that the shipping cost has a constant rate of change with respect to the number of orders.  In other words, the change in the shipping cost is directly proportional to the change in the number of orders.

## General Definitions

linear function
: A **linear function** is a function that can be written in the form $$y = mx + b$$, where $$x$$ represents the input, $$y$$ represents the output, and $$m, b$$ are constants.

In any linear function, $$y$$ is changing at a *constant rate* with respect to $$x$$.  In other words, every time $$x$$ goes up by 1, $$y$$ will go up (or down) by some constant amount.  That amount is determined by the *slope* of the line.  

slope
: The **slope** of a line tells you how quickly $$y$$ is changing with respect to $$x$$.  It's usually denoted by $$m$$.

If you already know two data points on the line (call them $$(x_1, y_1)$$ and $$(x_2, y_2)$$), then you can compute the slope using the following formula:

$$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

This formula can also be written in shorthand as $$m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$$, where the Greek letter Delta ($$\Delta$$) can be read as "change in __". In other words, the slope is the change in $$y$$ divided by the change in $$x$$.  From this perspective, we see that the slope is measuring how much change there is in $$y$$ per change in $$x$$.

slope-intercept form
: The equation of a line is said to be in **slope-intercept form** if it looks like $$y = mx + b$$.  In this form, $$m$$ tells you the slope and $$b$$ tells you the $$y$$-intercept (which we'll discuss below).

> **Warning**: $$m$$ and $$b$$ are allowed to be zero.  For example, in our shipping cost function, we have $$m = 8.25$$ and $$b = 0$$, so that $$y = 8.25 x + 0 = 8.25 x$$.
