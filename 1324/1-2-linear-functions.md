Linear Functions
===

In this section, we look at one of the simplest classes of functions: linear functions.

## Closely Related Quantities

Linear functions arise when one quantity has a constant rate of change with respect to another.  We saw an example of this in the last section, where we computed shipping costs.

Let's recall that function: $$f(x) = \$8.25 x$$.  Note that every time our order number $$x$$ goes up by 1, the shipping cost should go up by $8.25.  So we say that the shipping cost has a constant rate of change with respect to the number of orders.  In other words, the change in the shipping cost is directly proportional to the change in the number of orders.

## General Definitions

linear function
: A **linear function** is a function that can be written in the form $$y = mx + b$$, where $$x$$ represents the input, $$y$$ represents the output, and $$m, b$$ are constants.

slope
: The **slope** of a line tells you how much $$y$$ changes when $$x$$ increases by 1.

slope-intercept form
: The equation of a line is said to be in **slope-intercept form** if it looks like $$y = mx + b$$.  In this form, $$m$$ tells you the *slope* and $$b$$ tells you the $$y$$-intercept (which we'll discuss below).

Warning: $$m$$ and/or $$b$$ are allowed to be zero.  For example, in our shipping cost function, we have $$m = 8.25$$ and $$b = 0$$, so that $$y = 8.25 x + 0 = 8.25 x$$.
