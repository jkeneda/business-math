# Intro
There's a [Blackboard](https://southplainscollege.blackboard.com/) course associated with this.

- We should complete one edpuzzle before Thursday.

## Title V (Todd Holland)
We'll get a lot of info.  Todd says to keep what works for you, and lose what doesn't.  More on Title V later.

## Framing (Alan Worley)
Analogy to golf: simple concept, 90% mental.  You can be overwhelmed with swing thoughts unless you focus on one or two major things.  Pick a few things that will work well for your courses.

What do I want:
I'm old school - in-class lectures, out of class written homeworks.  I'm struggling with giving online students the same level of support/communication that they get in the classroom.  But recently I've been teaching hybrid 1324 classes (one in-perosn, one online meeting per week), and I want to find better ways to support that class in particular, given that we only have one in-person meeting, without adding costs (flipped class/making OER).

Random note: Sheyleah says Trig classes need lab time but state won't give it to us.

Robert: "Students need to use the calculator they were born with."

## Title V
Grant from Dept. of Education for Hispanic-serving (>26%) institutions.  We're 49%.
