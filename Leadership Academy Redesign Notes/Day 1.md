# Intro
There's a [Blackboard](https://southplainscollege.blackboard.com/) course associated with this.

- We should complete one edpuzzle before Thursday.

## Title V (Todd Holland)
We'll get a lot of info.  Todd says to keep what works for you, and lose what doesn't.  More on Title V later.

## Framing (Alan Worley)
Analogy to golf: simple concept, 90% mental.  You can be overwhelmed with swing thoughts unless you focus on one or two major things.  Pick a few things that will work well for your courses.

## Introducing Title V Grant Team
- Ashley Davis (Design Coordinator)
- Rebecca Grunder (Academic Support Coordinator)
- Lissa Sharp (Pathways Advising Specialist)
- Todd Holland (Program Director for Title V Grant)
- Gail Malone (Director of Teaching & Learning Center)
- Heather Medley (Instructional Designer)
- Dalila Gonzales (Admin. Assistant)

Who else is doing 1324:
- Morgan Groves
- Taek Jang

What do I want:
I'm old school - in-class lectures, out of class written homeworks.  I'm struggling with giving online students the same level of support/communication that they get in the classroom.  But recently I've been teaching hybrid 1324 classes (one in-perosn, one online meeting per week), and I want to find better ways to support that class in particular, given that we only have one in-person meeting, without adding costs (flipped class/making OER).

Random note: Sheyleah says Trig classes need lab time but state won't give it to us.

Robert: "Students need to use the calculator they were born with."

## Title V
Grant from Dept. of Education for Hispanic-serving (>26%) institutions.  We're 49%.

### Endgame Methods
- Using non-course-based options with a corequisite
- Faculty Leadership Academy
- Upgrade classrooms
- Academic coaching

By 2025, goal to improve TSIA achievement.

Redesign EDUC 1300.  Todd wants all dual-credit students to enroll.

Pathways - "how is the student gonna go from high school to their career"

Book rec - "Uncommon Sense Teaching" - author coming to speak later

### Contract Requirements
- Updated syllabus
- Two lesson plans
- Brief video that shows off a preview of redesign (can be addressed to Ashley instead of a full instructional video)
    - See contract for more info

Instructions are deliberately ambiguous - we want instructors to have flexibility in how to improve their courses.

## Academic Coaching
What is an academic coach?
- Works directly with students to tutor, coach, and mentor students

Side note: we should track usage of academic coaches, esp. which students are taking advantage

#### Tutoring
Small groups, one-on-one tutoring, or during an authorized session

#### Coaching
General academic strategies/habits

### Plan for Coaching
Plan by year:
1. Co-req math and english
2. High impact, high risk math (HIHR)
3. HIHR English
4. HIHR Sci & Tech
5. HIHR Behavioral & Social Sciences

### This Year's Program
46% of students never met with coach (maybe because they didn't need to), and 33% rated the experience as "excellent" (50% said good or better)

### Faculty & Coach Testimonials
Karol: aides used to be a hassle, but academic coaches work well

Sterling: was a non-trad student, thought he could improve his skills by coaching, his perspective was that his A effort was leverage for opening doors, like his current job; "you are one of them if you have been one of them"

Karol: the students feel more like they can approach Sterling than the prof

Maybe see if Tripp Scott wants to be an AC?

### Making a Difference Together
Physical props are important, but the most important part is investing in the individual student.

## Jen presents her course redesign experience
She redesigned 0324/1324 both hybrid and online.

Her main goal: Build relationship and student "buy in"

She tried:
- New Bb format
- Captioned w/ Verbit
- Redesigned Welcome Video and Email
- Built in Exam Reflections
- Implemented Academic Coach

### Welcome Video
- "Bottom Line Up Front"
- Top 2 Rule for communication

### Exam Reflections**
- Borrowed from Dr. HP
- Promotes innovation
    - Becky suggests: maybe we also plot the data as a "team strategy"
    - Reflect, & set a goal for the next test
    - Book rec: "Teach Students How to Learn" - Sandra McGuire

### Academic Coach
- Face-to-face and virtual hours simultaneously
- Incentivized tutoring after 1st exam (points for going for at least a 30 minute block)
- More success in the Fall, when she was in the classroom

"If I am not engaged, how can I expect the students to be?"

Steal other instructors' strategies and resources when you can.  :)

## Alma Lopez (Redesign of Coreq Stats Class)
Very social (nursing, etc.) students with weaker math backgrounds.  They start scared by book/syllabus.

One goal: make them more comfortable with engaging with application problems and book reading.  She shows stats "across all regions, women are more social".  Asks them to interpret.  *Affirms the word choice they use* as long as they understand the ideas.  Has them explain interpretation at the end of each problem.**

*Alma gets there 5-15 mins early as her "own warm-up act".*  Found a huge jump in not only math but english proficiency.

## For me: maybe focus on zoom out/zoom in idea for my redesign
