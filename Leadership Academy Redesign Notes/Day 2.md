## Presentation from Dr. Trena L. Wilkerson
Challenges with teaching and learning math.
Common themes:
- Lack of basic skills/learning opportunities
- Math anxiety/learned helplessness/bad mindset/attitude
- State expectations vs. academic freedom

Most students can name what turned them off to questions/mathematics.

Q: testing corequisite model for bringing up students success.  What about loss of 0315?

NCTM has a few recommendations for ways to empower students (develop positive math identity, etc.).

Boost confidence by framing the day's goals (1, 2, 3, etc.) and encourage the students to start thinking in this mathematical language.

Pose "purposeful" questions - plan 2 or 3 important questions that you want to ask before lecture.

Help students understand that "you learn from your mistakes" - struggle is productive.

Connect math represetations: learn $$P = 2l + 2w$$ and then do an example where you're building a flower bed against a house w/ fencing.  Why doesn't the formula work?

### Active Learning
- Communication: reading, writing, discussion
- Problem solving
- Promote higher-order thinking

See presentation for live links to some sample AL approaches.
Math Fluency: Flexibility over speed

National Academy for Sciences - free resources for real-world pictures of math applications. * Ask about.

My take-away: We're all having to navigate similar territory - especially when it comes to navigating tech resources in the classroom.

## Karol's Course Redesign
We needed a pep talk.  Dr. Satterwhite: remember why you became a teacher.

Kid President: If life is a game, are we all on the same team?

Karol wanted to change atmosphere and attitude.  Redecorated the room.  Didn't put up mathy things - she put up positive things. 

Growth mindset: the power of yet.

Results: more pleasant semester?  She felt better.

After the whiteboard desks came in:
They loved it.
- She tried pairing up and having the students evaluate the other student's solution.
- "REALLY" helped the students
The downside:
- Had to clean the desks all the time.

Kahoot worked really good in trig.  Not as much in coreq.  Read the audience.

All these tech tools are great - but there is no "secret ingredient".

Daily affirmation

"Not all of us can do great things.  But we can do small things with great love." - Mother Teresa.

## Leah Chenault Course Redesign and Kahoot
Know your "Why", and then the "What" becomes much easier.
*Teaching students to count is fine, but teaching them what counts is best.*

"Amazing Grace" example - first time he knew what, second time he knew why.

Think about your why.  Do most students know their why?

Leah wanted to be like Robert Pearce - impactful.

COVID was hard.  Left Leadership Academy inspired.  Wanted to build connections, even with online students.

### Whys
Sheyleah - socio-economic impact
Shirley - her dad didn't support women in anything but housework.  She viewed education as a way out of poverty.
Robert - born deaf and had a strong speech impediment.  Went to special needs pre-school.  Met small college math professor.  Wants to give that spark to learn to other students.

### Course Revamp Highlights (0332/1332)
Three major changes:
- Changes to first day (no math on Day 1!)
- Growth mindset and grit
- Review days

#### First day of class:
- Syllabus
- Motivational videos
- Class discussion
- Each student completes a personal info page, which include questions about videos
- No math

#### Growth mindset and grit
- Not good at math... yet
- Improve every day, every exam.
- Takes effort and work ethic.

#### Review days
Many of them don't know how to study.  Help them learn to study.
- Worked in groups on math review, Kahoot

### Kahoot
- Tried quiz on Kahoot
    - Gave prizes to winners
- Discuss right after the question - can see distribution of answers.
- Can be assigned
- Can be recycled
Downsides:
- Small/hard to read
- Math typesetting isn't LaTeX compatible - have to use an in-browser editor.

Questions: group sizes for discussions?

## "Learning HOW to Learn" - Dr. Gail Malone
First IQ test creator comment:
`It's not always the people who start out the smartest who end up the smartest.` - Alfred Binet

### What does "smart" mean?
- What kinds of messages have your students heard?
- Khan Academy: You can learn anything**
    - Nobody's born smart
- What is learning?
    - Making pathways
    - Students need to hear that their brains are changing at all times
    - The brain is more like a muscle than an eye color - you're not stuck with whatever state you had yesterday.*
        - What helps your brain is doing hard things - not easy things
        - The neural connections grow more when you get something wrong rather than right
        - Dr. Marian Diamond studied mice brains - exciting environments encouraged (neural?) growth
        - Patrick Mahomes: `Defeat helps you more than success.`

### Mindset
- What's a mindset?
- Instead of a failing grade, school gave grade "not yet"
- Growth mindset vs...
    - More persistence
    - Continuum instead of binary
- Fixed/stuck mindset (my intelligence was up for judgment and has failed)
    - Tyranny of now (vs. ...yet)
    - What are they likely to do?
        - Cheat
        - Find someone doing worse
        - Run from difficulty and errors (no learning attempt after defeat/hearing about their mistakes)
    - Ask themselves:
        - Will I succeed or fail?
        - Am I smart or dumb?
        - Am I worse than or better than the person next to me?
        - Binary thinking
- Bridge to yet
    - Praise wisely - don't praise innate intellect
        - Praise progress
    - Reward effort, strategy, progress
- Getting pushed out of comfort zone can make you smarter
- Equality:
    - Children (esp. in minority/socio-economic groups) have reinforced a fail/fixed mindset, feeling inevitable
    - Growth mindset helps break the cycle
- Tranforming the meaning of effort and difficulty
    - Earlier, they made the students feel dumb
    - Now, that's when they're getting smarter - building connections
- Book: "Mindset"
- Everyone can change and grow through experience
- People with no potential?**
- Rocky quote? It's about how hard you can get hit and keep going.
- Successfully intelligent people aren't afraid to make mistakes.
- Spanx woman: her dad asked kids what they'd failed at this week - disappointed they weren't trying new things if they hadn't failed
- Half hour intervention of growth mindset article cut dropout rate **in half**

#### Steps to a Growth Mindset
1. Learn to hear your stuck mindset inner voice
2. Recognize that you have a choice
3. Talk back with a growth mindset voice
4. Take growth mindset action

If you have a voice in your head telling you you're stupid, you can't, etc., tell that voice to shut up.

### Grit - Dr. Angela Duckworth
The predictor of success: not intelligence, IQ, success.

Grit is passion and determination for the long term.  Marathon, not sprint.*

How do I build grit in kids?
- We don't know. But:
    - Talent doesn't give you grit.
    - Grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to innate talent.
    - It's important to move past the idea that failure is a permanent condition.

Grit is keeping focus on your goal as you encounter setbacks.

## Title V Endgame: Bridges to Success - Lissa Sharpe
Grant includes career, academic, and financial pathway advising for students.  Large focus on transfer guides.

### Pathways to Success
Students who remain in A.A. degree or undeclared/gen studies:
- Less likely to prep for job
- Less likely to transfer a field of study
- Lower chance of completion
- Higher cost in time and money (including taxpayers)

39% of all undergrads start at community colleges.  
Of those:
- 80% intend to get a Bachelor's.  
- US average that transfer out is 34%.  
- Here: 24% graduate and transfer in 3 yr period.  
- 14% actually transfer and graduate.

We have to help students merge.
- Find a program aligning with their interests
- Connect them with faculty or students with similar interests
- Push exposure to "light their fire" course*
    - Even if a student is behind - try putting them in one "light their fire" course

What does this mean for us (faculty)?
- Connections
- Confidence
- Competence
- Community (we don't often get to see this part)

### Turn over to see new mySPC look
Enrique
Old SPC - It was a bit of a link farm...

## Reflection
What is the "Why?" behind your redesign.
- I felt like there was an abundance of free resources for e.g. college algebra, but my 1324 classes had to decide between an expensive textbook or weak OER support.  I wanted to focus on some open-access solutions to things like textbook and homework access.
- Incidentally, the academy has already also changed the way I'm gonna approach my Day 1 and building connections with my students.  I think that broadening the focus from my specific math class to their personal trajectories is also a good "why".
- I want to think carefully about adapting to this hybrid/flex model, which seems like it'll require tech solutions, which are usually expensive (for both institution and students).

(These activities are from the ? forward app.  Check Ashley's stuff.)

## Tomorrow:
We'll be starting at 9 in Lubbock.  Lubbock Technical Center.  41st & Q.  129 A & B.
