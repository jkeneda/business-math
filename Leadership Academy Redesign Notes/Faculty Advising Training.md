# Faculty Advising
## Introductions (led by Laci Alexander from Chem)

## Why are we doing this?
- We're an HSI (Hispanic-serving institution)
- Many of our students are non-traditional, don't have emphasis on college at home
- In STEM specifically, there's a surge of grant money for diversifying STEM

Want to find out:
- How to advise efficiently (what tools are available for us/them)
- How to relate to the students and advise pathways

## Pathways for Graduation (Lissa Sharp)
"You have to see/hear something seven times to remember it"

### Title V Endgame: Bridges to Success Initiative
Goal: to develop a comprehensive advising system here at the college.

1. Academic pathways
2. Career pathways
3. Financial pathways

We have 156 transfer pathways with our partner institutions.  All 48 of the Texas Tech pathways are up to date.

### Pathways to Success
Lissa was 1st gen college student, went through community college. Went to Clarendon College with very personal advising connections - we can make that a reality for our students too.
"They don't care how much you know until they know how much you care."

Good advisers *check in* periodically, throughout the semester.

#### Students who remain in AA/gen ed
- Less likely to prep for a job
- Less likely to transfer a complete field of study
- Lowers chances of credential completion
- Increases time and cost (to student and taxpayers)

39% of undergrad students start at a community college.  80% of them decide to get a Bachelor's degree.  Avg. who transfer out of their community college is 35%-ish.  Our average is 24%.

In the US, only 14% of those who intend to transfer actually complete their Bachelor's.

We have students who take up to 90 credit hours to just get their Associate's.  They only need 60.

It's okay for students to explore, as long as it doesn't *keep* them from making progress.

If they double-major and take too much here, then it can put them over the 120 hours at their transfer institution. **

#### Helping Students Merge
- Find a program that aligns with their interests
- Connect them with faculty and other students w/ similar interests
- Exposed to "light their fire"
	- It might be better to slow down on all of the remedial stuff if we can get them into a "light their fire" course - see transfer guides for course recommendations

#### Faculty should help students build
- Connections
- Confidence
- Competence (comes from other two)
- Community (we generally don't see this part - it's long-term impact)

Questions?
Dual-credit to frontload the basic requirements (makes sense usually)

How can we reach out to students that we don't even have in class? Karol emailed all on her advising list, and none responded. (Contact "early and often" - that's all we can do.)

Most people have two advisors - we rely on Advising & Testing to sort students successfully.

Sheyleah says: "Use MS Bookings for student scheduling" **

### Web Demonstration (slack shows up when one person drops, can use for class or organizational participation)

## Academic Coaching (Rebecca Grunder)
One word: support, lifesaver, intercessor

Works directly with faculty member(s) to
- tutor
- coach
- mentor and model healthy habits

Since they sit in on your class, we can be sure that the coach is approaching the problems in the way that *you* want.

### Who do we hire?
- Retired or future educators
- Current or previous students with good habits
- Professionals with some experience in education

### What are their duties?
- Sit in on class
- Facilitate small group exercises and discussions
- Provide one-on-one or group tutoring
- Provide tips and skills for generalized academic success

#### A coach does NOT:
- Teach new concepts
- Present to class without the instructor present
- Grade assignments or have access to course gradebook
- Not a go-fer

### Current State of The Title V Academic Coaching Plan
We have 17 coaches.  End goal: 40 coaches.

Target audience: Students who earn a C or below on their first major milestone/exam.

"I like that *they* reach out to us." - student review

Coaches can see students' exam grades in a stack, but they can't have gradebook access.

Can they meet with students at e.g. Starbucks?  OK, as long as it's not the norm.  Office hours should be better targeted/more formal than that.

## Connection with Students (SPC Counseling and Disabilities)

### Possible barriers
- race
- culture
- gender/sexuality
- socioeconomic status
- disailities
- students w/ children/demanding jobs
- mental/physical health challenges

### Special Populations (Perkins?)
They have scholarships for non-trad students in non-trad fields.  They also pay for child care or gas fees.** (ask for requirements there)
	- Scholarships available only for non-trad students in *technical* fields. They'd qualify as they transfer out to technical fields, e.g. nursing.

### Do I belong? Power of Mindsets
"If you tell a student, "you can't get more than a B," then they'll have that B stamped on their forehead throughout the semester.  That's their limit.
(Watched TED talk over Mindsets)

### How can I help?

### Building a Sense of Community
Students bring something unique and positive into the classroom.

One icebreaker: use index cards. On the back, write more in-depth questions.

### Listen
- Try to paraphrase to make sure you're on the same wavelength
- Ask questions
- Positive body language
- Empathy
- Avoid judgment
- Slow to give advice
- Evaluate the conversation holistically (maybe listening is enough)

### Empathy video** (I liked this a lot)
Active attempt to see reality from someone else's perspective

- Avoid formulating your response before fully listening to someone else's contribution to the conversation
- Empathy is a two way street

### Outreach
- Recognize
- Encourage and affirm
- Emphasize prior achievements
- Promote a sense of belonging (they're in the right place)

#### Normalize Help-Seeking Behaviors
*Some students may view 'asking for help' as proof that they don't belong! Emphasize that successful students ask for help.*
- Include resource directions in syllabus
- Normalize office hours (maybe make everyone drop by)
- Be flexible about meeting times
- Self-disclosure can help lower their anxiety

### Resources
- Health & Wellness Dept.
	- Personal counseling
	- Disability services
	- Free health clinic
	- Community resources/assistance (e.g. will find programs to help with rent, etc.)
- Food pantry
- Advising
- Campus police

*"Every person you encounter, no matter for how long, will change you in some way."*

# Day 2
## Interactive Activity
Can find demographic info under advise and texanconnect profile.

Career coach is a good recommendation for students who aren't sure** (refer to??)

If a student has some things that might be worth transfer credit, consider referring them to Sylvia Valdez (admissions)

Create your own advising flow/method.

To do: Advise 3 students.  In sharepoint, reflect on what we did (fix holds, explain how you chose classes, etc.).
